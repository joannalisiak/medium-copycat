# Medium Copycat Layout
## :book: About
Layout for an article page. The objective was to copy a [Medium article](https://medium.com/swlh/the-top-10-most-useful-online-courses-you-can-take-for-free-411aaa0dd80d) layout 
and create a [simplified version](https://joannalisiak.github.io/medium-copycat/). The layout consists of:
- Banner with a main title
- Paragraphs with subtitles
- Hoverable quote sections


Refresh the page to see the banner image changing! :sparkles:
